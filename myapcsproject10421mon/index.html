      <p>The goal of this Snap project was to create a number guessing game using the blocks provided as well as making our own custom blocks and variables. We use Snap as partners so I worked together with someone and there are two positions. One partner is the navigator and they tell you the directions and the other partner is the driver in which they actually do the programming and we change every 10 minutes in class periods. We accomplished this project by trial and error and it was challenging because we had to think outside the box of what the direction told us. I learned that communication is key whenever I am working with multiple people. </p>

      <p>Every Friday, we have a thing called Genius Hour where we work on certain topics that the whole class does not learn together. I am working on a Robot Simulator that has a setup that is similar to Snap. I can control the robot by placing movement and command blocks and I can see that in the playground where the robot moves around. In order to get the robot to do what you want, you sometimes have to keep doing trial and error and fix those errors. I learned that you can create a perfect code the first time. </p>
